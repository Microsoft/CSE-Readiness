## Operating Principles

The pillar should operate to build a stronger technical community, providing inspiration at every possible opportunity and serve it's members by delivering content that they need to be better technologists.  This work should be accomplished by giving space to voices that are not often heard from, allowing members to prove their competency as subject matter experts (SME).  Fostering a supportive community requires and eye for diversity and inclusion, keep this front and center in all decisions, content selction and interactions.

## Pillar Mission

This technical community chooses and creates the most appropriate human interaction for a specific scenario while leveraging cloud and services

## Pillar Scenarios

Bots and CaaP
Office Apps, Power BI Custom Visuals, Teams Extensions
Mobile and Client apps

## What the community does

Mainly:
- We give guidance on which type of HCI is relevant in a specific case and which techs are adapted to implement them​
- We identify common azure and other cloud services scenarios for HCI
- We facilitate hacks and seek 3rd party hacks to attend​
- We identify gaps in products and services feedback to engineering

Also:
- We look for recommendations on design and user experience​
- We identify community-driven OSS projects to contribute to​
- We have shared patterns, lessons learned and roadmaps​
- We provide reference implementations (1st or 3rd party)​
- We provide links to upskilling content​
- We track what's going on at conferences

## When do we meet and why?

- During the community calls (every other week), we mostly: Have open discussions, talk about code deep dive, talk about scenarios, talk about projects ideas
- Office hours (every Friday): Open discussions
- During reviews (every 6 weeks), we mostly: Do a community latest news overview. Review current projects (architecture, code)
